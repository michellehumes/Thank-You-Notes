# PAGE 15 — Client Acquisition Strategy Overview

## How Clients Find You (And How You Find Them)

Landing clients consistently is the single biggest challenge freelancers face. Talent alone will not fill your pipeline. You need a repeatable system that brings qualified leads to your door and converts them into paying clients without burning you out. This module gives you that system.

There are three core acquisition channels every freelancer should build. You do not need to master all three at once. Start with the one that matches your current situation, then layer in the others over time.

---

### Channel 1: Referrals (Warmest Leads, Highest Close Rate)

**What it is:** Past clients, colleagues, friends, and professional contacts sending new business your way.

**Why it works:** Referred leads arrive pre-sold. Someone they trust already vouched for you, which means shorter sales cycles, less price resistance, and higher-quality projects.

**How to activate it:**

- Deliver exceptional work (this is your foundation — nothing replaces it)
- Ask every satisfied client directly: *"Do you know anyone else who could use this kind of help?"*
- Send a brief check-in email to past clients every 60-90 days
- Create a simple one-line referral message clients can copy and forward
- Offer a referral incentive if it makes sense for your business (a discount on future work, a gift card, or a small finder's fee)

**Best for:** Freelancers who have completed at least 3-5 projects and have a base of happy clients to draw from.

---

### Channel 2: Outbound (You Go to Them)

**What it is:** Proactively reaching out to potential clients through cold email, direct messages, networking events, or strategic partnerships.

**Why it works:** You control the volume. When referrals dry up or you are entering a new niche, outbound lets you create opportunities on demand.

**How to activate it:**

- Identify 20-30 businesses or individuals who match your ideal client profile
- Research each one enough to personalize your outreach (recent news, a problem you noticed, a compliment on their work)
- Send a short, specific message that leads with the value you can provide — not a list of your services
- Follow up at least twice (most responses come on the second or third touch)
- Track every outreach in your Lead Tracking Sheet (next page)

**Best for:** Freelancers who are comfortable initiating conversations and want to target specific industries, company sizes, or project types.

---

### Channel 3: Inbound (They Come to You)

**What it is:** Attracting potential clients through content, social media presence, SEO, a portfolio website, or marketplace profiles.

**Why it works:** Inbound builds leverage over time. One strong portfolio piece, blog post, or social media thread can generate leads for months or years.

**How to activate it:**

- Build a portfolio site that showcases 3-5 of your best projects with clear results
- Post consistently on one platform where your ideal clients spend time
- Write case studies that show the problem, your process, and the outcome
- Optimize your LinkedIn headline and summary to clearly state who you help and how
- List your services on 1-2 relevant freelance platforms or directories

**Best for:** Freelancers who want to build long-term visibility and are willing to invest time upfront for compounding returns.

---

### Your Acquisition Mix

Most successful freelancers eventually use all three channels, but the ratio shifts over time. Here is a common progression:

| Stage | Referrals | Outbound | Inbound |
|---|---|---|---|
| Just starting out | 20% | 60% | 20% |
| 6-12 months in | 40% | 35% | 25% |
| Established (2+ years) | 50% | 15% | 35% |

**Your current primary channel:** [_______________]

**The channel you will build next:** [_______________]

**One specific action you will take this week to strengthen that channel:**

# PAGE 16 — Lead Tracking Sheet

## Never Lose a Potential Client Again

Every lead that enters your world needs a place to live. Without a tracking system, promising conversations slip through the cracks, follow-ups get forgotten, and revenue disappears. This sheet is your single source of truth for every potential client in your pipeline. Update it daily — it takes 60 seconds and saves you thousands.

---

### How to Use This Tracker

1. Add every lead the moment you become aware of them — even if it is just a name someone mentioned at a networking event.
2. Update the **Status** column after every interaction.
3. Never leave the **Next Action** column blank. If there is no next action, the lead is either closed-won or closed-lost.
4. Review your entire pipeline every Monday morning to prioritize your outreach for the week.

### Status Key

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| NEW | Just entered your pipeline — no contact yet |
| CONTACTED | You have reached out but have not had a conversation |
| DISCOVERY | Discovery call scheduled or completed |
| PROPOSAL | Proposal sent, waiting for response |
| NEGOTIATION | Discussing terms, scope, or pricing |
| WON | Contract signed — they are a client |
| LOST | Did not move forward (note the reason) |
| NURTURE | Not ready now but worth staying in touch |

# PAGE 17 — Discovery Call Script Template

## Turn Conversations Into Clients

The discovery call is where freelancers win or lose the deal. This is not a sales pitch — it is a structured conversation designed to understand the client's problem, demonstrate your expertise through the questions you ask, and determine whether you are a good fit for each other. Preparation separates the freelancers who close at 60%+ from those who scramble for scraps.

Print this script or keep it on a second screen during every call. Customize the bracketed sections to fit your service.

---

### Before the Call (2-Minute Prep)

- [ ] Research the client's business, website, and social media
- [ ] Review any prior communication (emails, DMs, referral context)
- [ ] Write down 2-3 specific observations or questions about their business
- [ ] Open a blank copy of the Discovery Call Notes Template (next page)
- [ ] Test your audio, video, and screen-sharing if applicable

---

### PART 1: OPENING (2-3 minutes)

**Build rapport and set the agenda so neither of you wastes time.**

> *"Hi [Client Name], thanks for making time for this. Before we dive in, I want to make sure we use this time well. Here is what I was thinking: I will spend the first few minutes learning about your business and what you are looking for. Then I will share a bit about how I work and whether I think I can help. At the end, we will talk about next steps. Does that work for you?"*

**If they brought a specific question or concern, acknowledge it first:**

> *"You mentioned [specific thing from their email/message] — I definitely want to dig into that. Let's start there."*

---

### PART 2: QUALIFYING QUESTIONS (12-15 minutes)

**Your goal is to understand three things: what they need, why they need it now, and whether they can afford you.** Ask these in a conversational flow, not as an interrogation. Listen more than you talk.

**Understanding their business:**

> *"Tell me a little about your business and who you serve."*

> *"What is working well right now?"*

**Understanding the problem:**

> *"What prompted you to look for help with [your service area] right now?"*

> *"How is this problem affecting your business day to day?"*

> *"How long has this been a challenge?"*

> *"Have you tried to solve this before? What happened?"*

**Understanding the desired outcome:**

> *"If we could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal result look like?"*

> *"How would you measure success for this project?"*

> *"Is there a specific deadline or event driving the timeline?"*

**Understanding the decision process:**

> *"Besides yourself, is anyone else involved in making this decision?"*

> *"Do you have a budget range in mind for this kind of work?"*

> *"What would need to happen for you to feel confident moving forward?"*

---

### PART 3: PRESENTING YOUR SOLUTION (5-7 minutes)

**Reflect back what you heard, then connect it to how you work. Do not list features — paint a picture of the outcome.**

> *"Based on what you have shared, it sounds like the core challenge is [restate their problem in your words]. What I would recommend is [brief overview of your approach]. The reason I would take that approach is [why it addresses their specific situation]."*

> *"For a project like this, my process typically looks like [2-3 high-level steps]. That usually takes [estimated timeline] and the investment is in the range of [price range if appropriate at this stage]."*

**If you are not ready to quote a price:**

> *"I want to put together a thoughtful proposal based on everything we discussed today. I will have that to you by [specific date]. It will include the full scope, timeline, and investment so you have everything you need to make a decision."*

---

### PART 4: HANDLING OBJECTIONS (as needed)

**The most common objections and how to address them without being pushy:**

**"I need to think about it."**
> *"Completely understand. What specific questions are still open for you? I want to make sure the proposal addresses everything."*

**"It is more than I expected."**
> *"I appreciate you being upfront about that. Let me ask — is it the total investment or the structure? Sometimes we can adjust the scope or break things into phases to make it work."*

**"I am talking to other freelancers too."**
> *"That is smart — you should find the right fit. What criteria are most important to you in making this decision? I want to make sure I give you everything you need to compare."*

**"Can you do it faster/cheaper?"**
> *"I can definitely look at ways to adjust the scope. What I would not want to do is cut corners on [the thing that matters most to their outcome]. Let me see what a phased approach might look like."*

---

### PART 5: CLOSING & NEXT STEPS (2-3 minutes)

**Never end a call without a clear, specific next step.**

> *"This has been really helpful. Here is what I would suggest for next steps: I will send over a [proposal / summary / follow-up email] by [specific day]. Once you have had a chance to review it, let's schedule a quick 15-minute call to go over any questions. Does [suggest a day] work?"*

> *"Is there anything else you want me to address in the proposal?"*

> *"Thanks again for your time, [Client Name]. I am excited about the possibility of working together."*

## Capture What Matters, Not Everything

# PAGE 22 — Proposal Tips & Quick-Reference

## Send Proposals That Actually Close

Writing a strong proposal is only half the battle. How and when you send it matters just as much. Use these guidelines to increase your close rate and avoid the most common mistakes freelancers make after a great discovery call.

---

### Proposal Timing Rules

| Situation | Send Within |
|---|---|
| High-interest lead (they are ready to go) | 24 hours of the discovery call |
| Standard lead (interested but not urgent) | 48 hours of the discovery call |
| Complex project (needs research or custom scoping) | 3-4 business days, with a heads-up email |

**The golden rule:** Every day you delay sending a proposal, your close rate drops. The excitement from the discovery call fades fast.

---

### Your Proposal Sending Checklist

Before you hit send, confirm every item:

- [ ] Client's name and company are spelled correctly throughout
- [ ] Project overview reflects their specific situation (not a generic template)
- [ ] Deliverables are clearly listed and match what you discussed
- [ ] Timeline is realistic and accounts for client feedback rounds
- [ ] Pricing is accurate and payment structure is clear
- [ ] Terms and conditions are included
- [ ] Signature lines are included for both parties
- [ ] Proposal has been proofread for typos and formatting issues
- [ ] File is saved as PDF (not a raw document they can edit)

---

### The Proposal Follow-Up Sequence

Do not send a proposal and wait in silence. Most clients need a gentle nudge.

| Day | Action |
|---|---|
| Day 0 | Send the proposal with a short, warm email summarizing next steps |
| Day 2 | Send a brief follow-up: *"Just checking that the proposal came through and you were able to open it. Happy to jump on a quick call if any questions come up."* |
| Day 5 | Send a value-add follow-up: share a relevant resource, case study, or idea related to their project |
| Day 8 | Direct follow-up: *"I want to respect your time — are you still considering this project? If timing has changed, no worries at all. Just let me know either way."* |
| Day 14 | Final follow-up: *"I am going to close out this proposal on my end, but if things change in the future, I would love to pick the conversation back up."* |

---

### Common Reasons Proposals Get Rejected (And How to Prevent Them)

| Reason | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Price shock | Mention your range during the discovery call so the proposal confirms, not surprises |
| Unclear scope | Be specific about what is and is not included |
| Too generic | Reference details from the discovery call to show you listened |
| Decision fatigue | Give them one clear recommendation, not five options |
| No urgency | Tie the timeline to their goals or deadlines discussed on the call |
| Lost momentum | Send the proposal fast and follow up consistently |

# PAGE 23 — Client Welcome Packet (Page 1 of 3)

## Make Every Client Feel Like Your Most Important Client

The welcome packet is the first thing a new client receives after signing. It sets the tone for the entire relationship, answers questions before they are asked, and signals that you are organized, professional, and easy to work with. Customize this packet once, then personalize the relevant sections for each new client.

---

## Welcome to [Your Business Name]

### About Me

[Write a warm, 3-4 sentence introduction. This is not your full bio — it is a human moment. Share why you do this work, what drives you, and one personal detail that makes you relatable. The goal is to make the client feel like they made the right choice.]

[_______________]

---

### My Values & Working Philosophy

**What you can always expect from me:**

- **Clear communication.** You will never wonder what is happening with your project. I provide regular updates and respond to messages within [_______________] business hours.

- **Honest guidance.** I will tell you what I genuinely believe will get the best results, even if it is not what you expected to hear. You hired me for my expertise, and I take that seriously.

- **Respect for your time.** I keep meetings focused, deliver on schedule, and do not waste your hours with unnecessary back-and-forth.

- **Quality work.** Every deliverable goes through my internal review process before it reaches you. I do not send first drafts as final work.

### How to Give Feedback That Moves the Project Forward

Great feedback is specific, actionable, and consolidated. Here is what works best:

**Instead of:** *"I do not like it."*
**Try:** *"The headline does not feel energetic enough for our audience. Can we try something more bold and direct?"*

**Instead of:** *"Can we try a bunch of different options?"*
**Try:** *"I am choosing between two directions. Can you show me what option A and option B would look like?"*

**Feedback process:**
1. I will send deliverables for review with a clear deadline for feedback
2. Collect all feedback from your team into one consolidated document or message
3. Send feedback to me by the agreed date
4. I will implement revisions and return the updated version within [_______________] business days

## Frequently Asked Questions & Policies

---

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I need to change the scope of the project after we start?**
Scope changes happen, and that is okay. If you need to add, remove, or modify deliverables, let me know as soon as possible. I will provide an updated timeline and cost estimate for your approval before any additional work begins.

**What if I need to pause or cancel the project?**
Life happens. If you need to pause, I ask for [_______________] days written notice. We will document where we left off so we can pick up smoothly. For cancellations, please refer to the cancellation terms in your signed proposal. Payment is due for all work completed up to the pause or cancellation date.

**How many revisions are included?**
Your project includes [_______________] rounds of revisions per deliverable. A revision round means one consolidated set of feedback. Additional rounds beyond what is included are available at $[_______________] per round.

**What does a "round of revisions" mean?**
One round = one set of consolidated changes submitted together. If three different stakeholders send me separate feedback emails on three different days, that counts as three rounds. Gathering all feedback into a single message saves you time and revision rounds.

**What if I am not happy with the final result?**
Your satisfaction matters to me. If something is not working, tell me specifically what feels off during the revision process so I can address it. My revision policy exists to make sure we land on a result you are proud of.

**Do you offer rush delivery?**
Yes, for an additional fee. Rush projects (delivery needed in less than [_______________] of the standard timeline) are subject to a [_______________]% rush fee and availability.

**Who owns the final work?**
You do, upon receipt of full payment. All final deliverables and associated intellectual property transfer to you. I retain the right to display the work in my portfolio unless we agree otherwise in writing.

# PAGE 26 — Client Onboarding Checklist

# PAGE 29 — Client Communication Guidelines Template

## Set Expectations Early, Avoid Problems Later

Communication breakdowns cause more project failures than skill gaps. This document sets clear, mutual expectations about how, when, and where you and your client will communicate throughout the project. Share it during onboarding and reference it any time communication gets off track. Boundaries are not unfriendly — they are professional, and good clients respect them.
