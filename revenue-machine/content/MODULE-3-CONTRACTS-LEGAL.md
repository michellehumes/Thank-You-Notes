### What This Module Includes

This module gives you a complete legal toolkit for your freelance business. Each template is written in clear, plain language so both you and your clients can understand every term. No confusing legalese. No hidden clauses. Just straightforward protection for both parties.

| Project-Based Contract | 34–35 | You are hired for a single, defined project with clear deliverables |
| Retainer Agreement | 36–37 | A client wants to secure your availability on an ongoing monthly basis |
| Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) | 38 | You or a client need to protect sensitive or confidential information |
| Scope Change / Change Order Form | 39 | The client requests work beyond the original agreement |
| Project Completion & Sign-Off Form | 40 | A project is finished and you need formal client approval |
| Late Payment Policy | 41 | You want to establish clear consequences for overdue invoices |

### How to Use These Templates

1. **Choose the right template** for your engagement type (see the Decision Tree on Page 43 if unsure).
2. **Fill in every blank field** marked with [_______________]. Do not leave any field empty.
3. **Customize the clauses** to match your specific services, pricing, and working style.
4. **Have both parties sign** before any work begins. Digital signatures (DocuSign, HelloSign, Adobe Sign) are legally valid in most jurisdictions.
5. **Keep signed copies** on file for at least three years after the project ends.
6. **Consult an attorney** if the project value exceeds $5,000, involves complex intellectual property, or if you have any doubts.

### A Note About Digital Signatures

Electronic signatures are legally recognized under the ESIGN Act (United States) and similar laws in many countries. Platforms like DocuSign, HelloSign, PandaDoc, and Adobe Sign provide timestamped, verifiable signatures that hold up in disputes. Using digital signatures is not only acceptable — it is standard professional practice.

# CONTRACT CLAUSE QUICK-REFERENCE GUIDE

---

> Not sure what a contract clause actually means? This guide explains the most common clauses you will encounter in freelance contracts — in plain English. Bookmark this page.

---

| Clause | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope of Work** | A clear description of exactly what you are being hired to do — and equally important, what you are *not* doing. | Prevents scope creep. If it is not listed here, it is not included. This is your first line of defense against "Can you also just quickly..." requests. |
| **Payment Terms** | When payment is due, how much, and what methods are accepted. Includes deposit requirements and late fee policies. | You need to eat. Clear payment terms eliminate awkward conversations and set professional expectations from day one. |
| **Timeline / Milestones** | The project schedule, including start date, key checkpoints, and final delivery date. | Keeps both parties accountable. If a client delays feedback, your deadlines shift too — and this clause proves it. |
| **Revisions** | How many rounds of changes are included in the price, what counts as a "revision" versus "new work," and what additional rounds cost. | Without this, clients can request unlimited changes. This clause draws the line between refining your work and restarting it. |
| **Intellectual Property (IP)** | Who owns the finished work — you or the client. Options include full transfer, licensed use, or a custom arrangement. | The most misunderstood clause in freelancing. Without it, ownership defaults to local law, which may not be in your favor. |
| **Confidentiality** | Both parties agree not to share sensitive information learned during the project. | Protects trade secrets, client data, your proprietary methods, and anything else that should not become public. |
| **Termination** | How either party can end the agreement, how much notice is required, and what happens to completed work and payments. | Projects sometimes fall apart. This clause ensures a clean, fair exit for everyone — no ghosting, no surprises. |
| **Limitation of Liability** | Caps the maximum amount you could be held financially responsible for if something goes wrong. | Protects you from being sued for more than you were paid. Essential for any project where your work could theoretically cause financial loss. |
| **Indemnification** | One party agrees to cover the other party's losses if certain problems arise (like a copyright claim on content the client provided). | Protects you if a client gives you materials they do not actually own and you get caught in the middle. |
| **Non-Compete** | Restricts you from working with the client's competitors for a specified period after the project. | Be cautious with these. A non-compete that is too broad can prevent you from earning a living in your niche. Negotiate narrow, reasonable terms. |
| **Non-Solicitation** | Prevents one party from hiring away the other party's employees or clients. | Protects your client relationships and your own team from poaching. |
| **Force Majeure** | Excuses performance if extraordinary events occur (natural disaster, pandemic, war, government action). | Protects both parties from liability when circumstances are genuinely beyond anyone's control. |
| **Dispute Resolution** | Specifies how disagreements will be handled — negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or court. | Keeps disputes out of expensive courtrooms when possible. Mediation and arbitration are faster and cheaper than litigation. |
| **Governing Law** | Identifies which state's or country's laws apply to the contract. | If you are in Texas and your client is in California, whose rules apply? This clause answers that question before it becomes a problem. |
| **Entire Agreement / Integration** | States that the signed contract is the complete and final agreement, overriding any prior verbal promises or emails. | Prevents a client from claiming "But you said on the phone that..." This clause says: if it is not in the signed contract, it does not count. |
| **Severability** | If one clause is found invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the contract still stands. | Prevents the entire contract from collapsing because of one problematic provision. |
| **Assignment** | States whether either party can transfer the contract to someone else without permission. | Prevents your client from handing your contract off to a different company you never agreed to work with. |

---

**Pro Tip:** You do not need every clause in every contract. But you should always include: Scope of Work, Payment Terms, Revisions, Intellectual Property, Termination, and Limitation of Liability. These six are non-negotiable.

### COMMON SCENARIO EXAMPLES

**Scenario 1:** "A startup wants me to build their brand identity — logo, brand guide, and website."
- **Use:** Project-Based Contract (Pages 34–35)
- **Why:** This is a defined project with clear deliverables, milestones, and an endpoint.

**Scenario 2:** "A marketing agency wants me to write 8 blog posts per month, every month."
- **Use:** Retainer Agreement (Pages 36–37)
- **Why:** This is ongoing, recurring work with a predictable monthly scope.

**Scenario 3:** "A friend of a friend wants some quick design help — nothing too formal."
- **Use:** General Service Agreement (Pages 32–33)
- **Why:** Even casual work needs a contract. The General Agreement is flexible enough for informal engagements while still protecting you.

**Scenario 4:** "A client shared their business plan with me and I want to make sure I'm protected."
- **Use:** NDA (Page 38)
- **Why:** An NDA protects both parties when sensitive information is exchanged, even before a project contract is signed.

**Scenario 5:** "My client wants to add a mobile app to the website project we already agreed on."
- **Use:** Scope Change / Change Order Form (Page 39)
- **Why:** This is a major addition to the original scope. Document it, price it, and get it signed before doing the work.

---

### THE GOLDEN RULES OF FREELANCE CONTRACTS

1. **Always use a contract.** No exceptions. Not even for friends. Not even for small projects.
2. **Get it signed before you start.** A contract signed after the fact has less protective power.
3. **Never work without a deposit.** If a client will not pay a deposit, they are not a client.
4. **Put everything in writing.** Verbal agreements are worth the paper they are printed on.
5. **When in doubt, use the General Service Agreement.** It is flexible enough for most situations.

# MODULE 3 ACTION STEPS SUMMARY

---

> You now have a complete legal toolkit. But templates only protect you if you actually use them. Here is your action plan.

---

### YOUR LEGAL PROTECTION CHECKLIST

Work through this checklist to ensure your freelance business is legally protected:

---

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do This Week)**

- [ ] Read through all contract templates in this module and choose the ones relevant to your business.
- [ ] Fill in your standard business information (name, address, email, payment methods) in each template so they are ready to customize per client.
- [ ] Set your standard terms: revision rounds, payment due dates, late fee percentages, notice periods.
- [ ] Save your completed templates in an easily accessible folder (Google Drive, Dropbox, or your project management tool).
- [ ] Set up a digital signature account (DocuSign, HelloSign, PandaDoc, or Adobe Sign) if you do not already have one.

---

**FOR YOUR NEXT CLIENT**

- [ ] Determine which contract template fits the engagement (use the Decision Tree on Page 43).
- [ ] Customize the template with the client's specific project details, deliverables, and timeline.
- [ ] Review the filled-in contract carefully before sending — every blank field should be completed.
- [ ] Send the contract for signature before starting any work.
- [ ] Collect your deposit before delivering anything.
- [ ] Save the signed contract in your client's project folder.

---

**ONGOING HABITS**

- [ ] Use the Change Order Form (Page 39) every time a client requests work outside the original scope — no exceptions.
- [ ] Use the Project Completion & Sign-Off Form (Page 40) at the end of every project to get formal approval.
- [ ] Follow your Late Payment Policy (Page 41) consistently. Enforcing it once makes it easier every time after.
- [ ] Review and update your contract templates every 6 months, or after any situation where a clause did not adequately protect you.
- [ ] Consult an attorney for any high-value contract (over $5,000) or any engagement that feels complex or risky.

---

**RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR**

If a client does any of the following, proceed with extreme caution:

- [ ] Refuses to sign a contract ("Let's just get started and figure it out later.")
- [ ] Refuses to pay a deposit ("I'll pay you when the project is done.")
- [ ] Pushes back on every clause ("I don't agree with any of these terms.")
- [ ] Wants you to start immediately but "the paperwork will come later."
- [ ] Verbally promises things but will not put them in writing.
- [ ] Has a history of disputes with other freelancers.

**Your response to every one of these situations should be the same:** "I am happy to discuss terms, but I require a signed agreement and deposit before I begin any work. This protects both of us."

---

### RECOMMENDED PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES

For additional legal protection, consider these next steps:

- [ ] Have a local attorney review your customized contract templates (one-time investment that pays for itself).
- [ ] Look into professional liability insurance (also called Errors & Omissions insurance).
- [ ] Register your business as an LLC or other legal entity to protect your personal assets.
- [ ] Keep records of all contracts, invoices, and client communications for at least 3 years.

---

### MODULE 3 COMPLETE

You now have the legal foundation to operate your freelance business with confidence. Contracts are not about distrust — they are about clarity. When both parties know exactly what to expect, the working relationship is stronger, smoother, and more professional.

**Next up: Module 4** — where we build the systems to manage your projects, clients, and workflow like a well-oiled machine.
