## PAGE 7: PRICING STRATEGY CALCULATOR — HOURLY RATE

### Calculate Your True Hourly Rate

Most freelancers undercharge because they forget about taxes, expenses, and non-billable hours. This calculator fixes that.

**STEP 1: Your Annual Income Goal**
Target annual income (what you want to take home): $[___________]

**STEP 2: Add Your Costs**

| Expense Category | Annual Amount |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Self-employment tax (~15.3%) | $[___________] |
| Income tax estimate (~20-25%) | $[___________] |
| Health insurance | $[___________] |
| Software & tools | $[___________] |
| Professional development | $[___________] |
| Business insurance | $[___________] |
| Home office / coworking | $[___________] |
| Marketing & advertising | $[___________] |
| Other expenses | $[___________] |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COSTS** | **$[___________]** |

**STEP 3: Calculate Required Revenue**
Income goal + Total costs = Required revenue
$[___________] + $[___________] = **$[___________]**

**STEP 4: Calculate Billable Hours**

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Weeks you want to work per year | [___] weeks |
| Minus vacation/sick time | - [___] weeks |
| = Working weeks | [___] weeks |
| Hours per week you want to work | [___] hours |
| Minus non-billable time (~30-40%) | - [___] hours |
| = Billable hours per week | [___] hours |
| **Total annual billable hours** (weeks x hours) | **[___] hours** |

**STEP 5: Your Minimum Hourly Rate**
Required revenue / Annual billable hours = Minimum hourly rate
$[___________] / [___] = **$[___________] /hour**

**YOUR RATES:**
| Rate Level | Rate | When to Use |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Minimum (break-even) | $[_____]/hr | Never go below this |
| Standard | $[_____]/hr | Regular clients |
| Premium | $[_____]/hr | Rush/specialized work |

## PAGE 8: PRICING STRATEGY CALCULATOR — PROJECT RATE

### Calculate Project-Based Pricing

Project pricing is usually more profitable than hourly. Here's how to price projects accurately.

**PROJECT: [________________________]**

**STEP 1: Estimate Time**

| Phase | Estimated Hours |
|-------|----------------|
| Discovery / research | [___] hours |
| Planning / strategy | [___] hours |
| Core execution | [___] hours |
| Revisions (estimate 2 rounds) | [___] hours |
| Communication / meetings | [___] hours |
| Admin / file management | [___] hours |
| **TOTAL HOURS** | **[___] hours** |

**STEP 2: Calculate Base Price**
Total hours x Your hourly rate = Base price
[___] x $[___] = **$[___________]**

**STEP 3: Add Project Factors**

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|-----------|
| Complexity premium (+10-25%) | + $[___________] |
| Rush premium (+25-50%) | + $[___________] |
| Expertise premium (+15-30%) | + $[___________] |
| Scope risk buffer (+10%) | + $[___________] |
| **TOTAL PROJECT PRICE** | **$[___________]** |

**STEP 4: Sanity Check**
- Does this price reflect the VALUE to the client? [ ] Yes [ ] No
- Would I be happy doing this work at this price? [ ] Yes [ ] No
- Is this competitive in my market? [ ] Yes [ ] No

If any answer is "No," adjust before quoting.

**PAYMENT STRUCTURE:**
| Option | Split |
|--------|-------|
| Option A | 50% upfront / 50% on delivery |
| Option B | 33% upfront / 33% midpoint / 34% on delivery |
| Option C | 100% upfront (for projects under $[___]) |

## PAGE 9: PRICING STRATEGY CALCULATOR — VALUE-BASED

### Price Based on the Value You Deliver, Not Hours You Work

Value-based pricing is the highest-margin approach. It works when your work directly impacts your client's revenue, saves them significant time, or solves a painful problem.

**THE VALUE-BASED PRICING FRAMEWORK**

**STEP 1: Quantify the Client's Problem**
What is this problem costing the client? (Revenue lost, time wasted, opportunities missed)

| Cost Type | Estimated Annual Cost to Client |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Lost revenue | $[___________] |
| Wasted time (hours x their rate) | $[___________] |
| Missed opportunities | $[___________] |
| Stress / frustration (qualitative) | [___________] |
| **TOTAL PROBLEM COST** | **$[___________]** |

**STEP 2: Quantify Your Solution's Value**
What will your work save/earn them?

| Value Type | Estimated Annual Value |
|------------|----------------------|
| Revenue increase | $[___________] |
| Time saved | $[___________] |
| Cost reduction | $[___________] |
| Risk mitigation | $[___________] |
| **TOTAL SOLUTION VALUE** | **$[___________]** |

**STEP 3: Price at 10-20% of Value Delivered**
If your solution is worth $50,000/year to the client, pricing at $5,000-$10,000 is a no-brainer for them.

Total Solution Value x [10-20%] = Your Price
$[___________] x [___]% = **$[___________]**

**VALUE CONVERSATION SCRIPT:**
"Based on what you've shared, this problem is costing your business approximately $[____] per year. My solution will [specific outcome], which typically delivers [specific value]. My investment for this is $[____], which means you'll see a [X]x return within [timeframe]."
