## PAGE 45 — Project Management Overview

---

### Why Most Freelancers Lose Money on Projects

It is rarely about skill. You know how to do the work. The problem is scope that quietly expands, timelines that slip because nothing was written down, and deliverables that get revised six times because expectations were never nailed to the wall.

Project management is not corporate overhead. It is the difference between a project that earns you $5,000 in 20 hours and one that earns you $5,000 in 60 hours. Same invoice, completely different hourly rate.

This module gives you a system that is simple enough to actually use and structured enough to protect your time, your money, and your sanity.

---

### The 3-Phase Approach

Every freelance project — whether it takes two days or six months — moves through three phases. Master these and you will never feel lost in the middle of a project again.

---

**PHASE 1: PLAN**

This is where you protect yourself before a single hour of work begins.

- Define the project scope in writing (what is included, what is not)
- Identify every deliverable and its format
- Set milestones with specific dates
- Estimate hours realistically (then add 20% buffer)
- Confirm the client's review and approval process
- Document communication preferences and response expectations

**Key question to answer:** "What does DONE look like for this project?"

---

**PHASE 2: EXECUTE**

This is the actual work — but with guardrails.

- Work in phases, not one giant push
- Track your hours from day one, not retroactively
- Send proactive status updates before the client has to ask
- Flag scope changes immediately using a revision request process
- Complete your own QA review before delivering anything

**Key question to answer:** "Am I still on scope, on time, and on budget?"

---

**PHASE 3: CLOSE**

This is where most freelancers drop the ball. A clean close protects your reputation and sets up repeat business.

- Deliver all final files in the agreed format
- Walk the client through what they are receiving
- Collect final payment before handing off source files
- Request a testimonial while the positive experience is fresh
- Run your own post-project review to capture lessons learned

**Key question to answer:** "Is this project fully complete with nothing left open?"

## PAGE 46 — Master Project Tracker

---

### Your Bird's-Eye View of Every Active Project

If you cannot glance at one page and know exactly where every project stands, you are operating blind. This tracker is your command center. Update it at least twice per week — ideally every time a project status changes.

**How to use this tracker:**
- Add every project the moment a contract is signed
- Update status and hours weekly at minimum
- Move completed projects to an archive section monthly
- Use the Notes column to flag anything that needs your attention

### Plan the Project Before You Touch the Work

This planner is your blueprint for a single project. Fill it out before you write a single line of copy, design a single screen, or write a single line of code. The 30 minutes you spend here will save you hours of rework later.

Complete this planner after your discovery call and before you start billable work.

### Plan the Week Before the Week Plans You

Every Sunday evening or Monday morning, spend 15 minutes filling this out. Map your tasks to specific days. Assign priority levels so that when interruptions hit (and they will), you know exactly what matters most.

**Priority Key:** P1 = Must be done today, non-negotiable | P2 = Important, do after P1s | P3 = Nice to have, move if needed

## PAGE 49 — Daily Priority Matrix

---

### Stop Treating Everything Like It Is Urgent

Most freelancers work reactively — whatever is loudest gets done first. That is a recipe for burnout and missed deadlines on the work that actually matters. Use this matrix every morning. It takes five minutes and completely changes your day.

**How it works:** Write every task for today into the correct quadrant. Then work the quadrants in order: Q1 first, Q2 second, Q3 delegate or batch, Q4 eliminate.

---

**Date:** [__/__/__]

---

### TODAY'S TOP 3 NON-NEGOTIABLE PRIORITIES

*If you only get three things done today, make it these three.*

**1.** [_______________________________________________________________]

**2.** [_______________________________________________________________]

**3.** [_______________________________________________________________]

---

### THE PRIORITY MATRIX

---

#### Q1: URGENT + IMPORTANT — Do These First

*Deadlines today. Client emergencies. Work that cannot wait.*

- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]

**Time blocked for Q1:** [____] – [____]

---

#### Q2: IMPORTANT, NOT URGENT — Schedule These

*Strategic work. Business development. Systems building. The work that grows your business but never screams for attention.*

- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]

**Time blocked for Q2:** [____] – [____]

---

#### Q3: URGENT, NOT IMPORTANT — Delegate or Batch

*Emails. Most messages. Admin requests. Things that feel urgent but do not move the needle.*

- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]

**Batching plan:** Handle all Q3 tasks during [____] – [____] and then stop.

---

#### Q4: NEITHER URGENT NOR IMPORTANT — Eliminate

*Busywork. Scrolling. Reorganizing things that do not need reorganizing. Be honest.*

- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]
- [ ] [_______________________________________________________________]

**Decision:** Cross these out. Do not do them today. If they matter, they will show up in Q2 tomorrow.

---

### End-of-Day Check-In

**Did I complete my Top 3?** [ ] Yes / [ ] No

**If no, what got in the way?** [_______________________________________________________________]

**How much time did I spend in Q1 vs Q2 today?** Q1: [____] hrs | Q2: [____] hrs

**Tomorrow's most important task:** [_______________________________________________________________]

---

**Reality check:** If you spend most of your time in Q1 every day, you are not planning far enough ahead. The goal is to spend the majority of your week in Q2 — the important, non-urgent quadrant. That is where real business growth happens.

### Your Last Line of Defense Before Delivery

This is the checklist you complete after you think the work is done but before the client sees it. Every mistake caught here is a revision round avoided, a reputation protected, and a relationship preserved.

Do not skip this. Print it. Use it on every project.

## PAGE 53 — Project Status Update Template

---

### Proactive Updates Build Client Trust

Do not wait for the client to ask "How's it going?" — that question means you have already waited too long. Send a status update at every milestone or at least weekly on active projects. Use this template. It takes five minutes and makes you look polished and reliable.

Copy the format below into an email, shared doc, or project management tool.

## PAGE 54 — Revision Request Form

**How to use this form:**
- Share this template with clients at project kickoff
- Ask them to fill it out for every revision round
- Log whether each change is within scope or an add-on

## PAGE 57 — Time Tracking Log

---

### If You Do Not Track It, You Cannot Price It

Time tracking is not about being obsessive. It is about knowing the truth. How long does a logo actually take you? How many hours do you spend on client calls? What is your real hourly rate once admin work is factored in? You cannot answer any of these questions without data.

Track every working day. Review weekly. Adjust your pricing quarterly based on what the numbers tell you.

## PAGE 58 — Module 4 Action Steps Summary

---

### Put This Module to Work

You now have every template you need to plan, execute, and close freelance projects like a professional. But templates only work if you use them. Here is your action plan.

---

### Immediate Actions (Do This Week)

- [ ] **Set up your Master Project Tracker (Page 46)** — Add every current project. Update the status, hours, and payment columns. This becomes your single source of truth for all active work.

- [ ] **Complete a Single Project Planner (Page 47) for your most important active project** — Even if the project is already underway, filling this out now will expose gaps in your plan. Pay special attention to the deliverables list, dependencies, and what is NOT included.

- [ ] **Start tracking your time (Page 57)** — Starting today, log every hour. You do not need a fancy app. This log works. After two weeks, calculate your actual effective hourly rate. If the number surprises you, it is time to raise your prices or tighten your scope.

---

### Weekly Habits to Build

- [ ] **Plan your week every Sunday or Monday morning using the Weekly Task Planner (Page 48)** — 15 minutes of planning saves hours of reactive scrambling. Map your P1 tasks first.

- [ ] **Start each work day with the Daily Priority Matrix (Page 49)** — Five minutes. Three priorities. Four quadrants. This single habit will change how productive you are.

- [ ] **Send a Project Status Update (Page 53) on every active project** — Weekly or at every milestone. Clients who receive proactive updates almost never send the dreaded "just checking in" email.

- [ ] **Update your Master Project Tracker** — At least twice per week. Status, hours used, and payment status should always be current.

---

### Per-Project Habits to Build

- [ ] **Before starting any new project:** Complete the Single Project Planner (Page 47) and the Project Timeline (Page 50). Share a simplified timeline with your client.

- [ ] **Before any client delivery:** Run through the QA Review Checklist (Page 52) and the Client Deliverables Checklist (Page 51). Every time, no exceptions.

- [ ] **When a client requests revisions:** Send them the Revision Request Form (Page 54). This is not bureaucracy — it is scope protection.

- [ ] **When a project ends:** Complete the Project Handoff Checklist (Page 55) and the Post-Project Review (Page 56) within 48 hours. This is how you get better, faster, and more profitable with every project.

---

### Monthly Review

At the end of each month, answer these questions:

**1. How many projects did I complete this month?** [______]

**2. What was my average effective hourly rate?** $[______]

**3. What percentage of my time was billable?** [______]%

**4. Did any projects go over budget on hours? Which ones and why?**

[_______________________________________________________________]

**5. What is the one process change that would save me the most time next month?**

[_______________________________________________________________]

---

### The Non-Negotiable Rule

Here it is, the one rule that underpins this entire module:

**Write it down before you start. Track it while you work. Review it when you finish.**

That is the entire system. Every template in this module supports one of those three actions. Planning protects your scope. Tracking protects your income. Reviewing protects your growth.

You do not need to be a project management expert. You need to be a freelancer who does not lose money, miss deadlines, or burn out because the work was never organized in the first place.

You have the tools. Use them.
