- Keyword alignment is done against the client's *specific* target roles, not generic industry terms
- Deliverables include strategy context (why changes were made) so clients can adapt going forward
- 48-hour turnaround standard (vs. 5-7 day industry average)
- Revision included — we don't ship and disappear
