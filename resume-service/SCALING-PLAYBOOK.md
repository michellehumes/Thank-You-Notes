# CareerForge Pro — Scaling Playbook

## Phase 1: First 5 Clients (Days 1-14)

### Goal
Get 5 paying clients. Validate pricing. Refine fulfillment workflow.

### Pricing

### Lead Generation (Week 1)

2. **LinkedIn (daily, 20 min):** Send 10 personalized connection requests to job seekers. Post 1 short-form tip per day.
3. **Upwork:** List 3 gigs. Price at the *low end* of your tier pricing to build initial reviews. Raise prices after first 5 reviews.
4. **Fiverr:** List 2 gigs with Tier 1 pricing. Use "Fiverr Choice" optimization (24-hour response, quick delivery option).
5. **Personal network:** Send 10 messages to people you know who might be job searching or know someone who is.

### Fulfillment Workflow
1. Client submits intake form → JSON downloaded to your machine
2. Open fulfillment-engine.html → paste data → run analysis
3. Copy generated prompts → paste into Claude → get deliverables
4. Review, refine, format in Google Docs or Word
5. Deliver via email (PDF + DOCX)
6. Follow up in 3 days for revision requests

### Key Metrics to Track
- Leads generated per channel
- Conversion rate (lead → paid client)

## Phase 3: Scaling (Days 30-60)

### Revenue Targets
- Week 1-2: $500-1,000 (3-5 clients)
- Week 3-4: $1,500-2,500 (5-8 clients)
- Week 5-8: $3,000-5,000 (10-15 clients)

### Capacity Management
At 2-3 hours per client, you can handle ~15 clients/week solo.

When you hit 10+ clients/week consistently:
1. **Systematize:** Create SOPs for each step of the fulfillment process
2. **Template library:** Build reusable prompt templates for common industries/roles
3. **Hire a VA ($15-20/hr):** For formatting, file preparation, client communication
4. **Consider a subcontractor ($50-75/resume):** For overflow during peak periods

### Channel Expansion
- **Content marketing:** Start a weekly LinkedIn newsletter on job search tips. Build audience → convert to clients.
- **YouTube Shorts / TikTok:** "Resume mistake of the week" — 60-second videos reviewing real (anonymized) resume issues.
- **Partnerships:** Career coaches, bootcamp alumni networks, professional associations.
- **SEO:** If hosting the landing page on a custom domain, write 5-10 blog posts targeting "ATS resume optimization," "resume writing service for [industry]," etc.

### Product Expansion Ideas (Test One at a Time)
1. **Interview coaching sessions ($150/hour):** Live practice with feedback
2. **Resume template shop ($29-49):** Pre-formatted ATS-safe templates
3. **Job search strategy call ($99):** 45-minute consultation
4. **Monthly retainer ($199/month):** Ongoing resume updates + 2 tailored versions per month
5. **Group workshop ($49/person):** "Fix Your Resume in 90 Minutes" — live Zoom workshop
