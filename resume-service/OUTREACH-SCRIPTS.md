# CareerForge Pro — Outreach & Lead Generation Scripts

## Reddit Scripts (r/jobs, r/resumes, r/careerguidance, r/cscareerquestions)

**Note:** Reddit hates overt self-promotion. These are designed as genuinely helpful comments that position you as an expert. Only link your service when directly relevant or when someone asks. Build karma first by being useful.

---

### Reddit Script 1 — Responding to "Why am I not getting callbacks?"

> The most common reason I see when reviewing resumes: they describe duties instead of achievements.

> "Managed a team of 5" tells a recruiter nothing. "Led a 5-person team that shipped a product feature generating $200K in new ARR within 60 days" — that gets callbacks.

> The formula is: **Action verb + what you did + quantified result + timeframe.**

> The other silent killer: ATS formatting. If your resume uses tables, multi-column layouts, or graphics, most applicant tracking systems literally can't read it. Your application gets auto-rejected before a human ever sees it.

> Happy to take a quick look at your resume if you want to DM it — I do this professionally and can spot the issues in about 30 seconds.

---

### Reddit Script 2 — Responding to "Is my resume okay?"

> Took a look. A few things that would immediately improve your callback rate:

> 1. Your summary reads like a job description, not a value proposition. Recruiters skim the top 3 lines — those need to answer "why should I call this person?"
> 2. I count zero quantified achievements. Every bullet should answer "so what?" with a number.
> 3. Your skills section is at the bottom. If you're applying through ATS systems, move it above experience so the keyword matching picks it up early.

> The bones are good — your experience is strong. The presentation just needs work. This is a positioning problem, not a qualifications problem.

---

### Reddit Script 3 — Responding to "How do I get past ATS?"

> Former recruiter here [or: I've optimized 100+ resumes for ATS]. The biggest misconceptions about ATS:

> 1. **It's not a "score."** Most ATS systems parse your resume into structured data fields. If the parsing fails (tables, columns, graphics), your data gets scrambled and you get auto-filtered.
> 2. **Keywords matter, but context matters more.** Don't stuff keywords. Use them naturally in achievement bullets. "Managed Salesforce CRM for 50-person sales team" > "Skills: Salesforce."
> 3. **The job description IS the cheat sheet.** Copy the JD into a word cloud tool. The top 10-15 terms that aren't generic ("team," "role") are what you need in your resume.
> 4. **File format matters.** DOCX > PDF for most ATS. Some older systems choke on PDFs.

> Single column. Standard fonts. Clear section headers (EXPERIENCE, EDUCATION, SKILLS). That's 80% of the battle.

---

### Reddit Script 4 — Thread starter for r/resumes

> **What I learned reviewing 50 resumes this month (the same 5 mistakes keep showing up)**

> I optimize resumes professionally. Here are the patterns I see constantly:

> 1. **No numbers anywhere.** If you can't quantify it, you can't prove it happened. Even estimates work: "Approximately 30% improvement" > nothing.
> 2. **Summary that could belong to anyone.** "Results-driven professional with 10 years of experience" — delete this. Replace with something specific to your career.
> 3. **Two pages when one would do.** Unless you're 15+ years into your career or in academia, one page. Ruthlessly cut.
> 4. **Skills listed without context.** "Python" means nothing. "Built automated reporting pipeline in Python, reducing monthly report generation from 8 hours to 20 minutes" — that's real.
> 5. **Formatting that breaks ATS.** Tables, text boxes, headers/footers, icons. All invisible to most ATS systems.

> Happy to answer questions. This stuff is fixable in an afternoon if you know what to look for.

---

### Reddit Script 5 — Responding to career pivoters

> Career pivots are 100% doable — but you need to reframe everything on your resume around the *transferable* skills, not the industry-specific ones.

> Example: You're moving from teaching to project management? "Managed classroom of 30 students" becomes "Managed 30+ stakeholders across multiple concurrent workstreams with competing deadlines."

> Same experience. Different framing. Completely different perception.

> The trick: Read 10 job descriptions for your target role. Identify the top 5 skills they all mention. Then rewrite every bullet on your resume to demonstrate those 5 skills using your existing experience.

> It's not lying — it's strategic positioning.

---

### Reddit Script 6 — Salary negotiation thread

> The biggest mistake I see: accepting the first offer without negotiating.

> Almost every company builds 10-20% headroom into initial offers. They *expect* you to negotiate. When you don't, you're leaving money on the table — and that lower base salary compounds for your entire career.

> Framework:
> 1. Never give a number first. "I'd love to understand the full scope of the role before discussing compensation."
> 2. When they make an offer, express enthusiasm first. Then: "I'm excited about this opportunity. Based on my research and the scope of this role, I was targeting [15-20% above their offer]. Is there flexibility?"
> 3. If they can't move on base, negotiate the package: signing bonus, equity, PTO, remote days, title, review timeline.

> I include a full salary negotiation script with my executive resume packages because this single conversation can be worth more than the resume itself.

### Reddit Scripts 7-10 — Quick response templates

**#7 — When someone shares their resume:**
> Solid experience. Two quick wins: (1) swap "responsible for" with action verbs — led, built, drove, optimized; (2) add numbers to your top 3 bullets. Those two changes alone will noticeably improve your callback rate.

**#8 — When someone asks about resume services:**
> Depends on your budget and what you need. The $30-50 options on Fiverr are mostly templates. If you're applying to competitive roles and need real keyword optimization against specific JDs, you need someone who'll actually analyze your target roles. I'd budget $150-300 for quality work with a turnaround under a week.

**#9 — When someone is frustrated with their search:**
> The job market is brutal right now, but most people I work with have a positioning problem, not a qualifications problem. When your resume gets rewritten to actually showcase what you've accomplished (with numbers), the same background suddenly gets callbacks. It's the same person — just better packaging.

**#10 — When someone asks about LinkedIn:**
> Your LinkedIn headline is the most valuable 220 characters in your job search. Recruiters search by keywords — if your headline says "Open to Work" instead of your target role + top skills, you're invisible. Format: "Target Role | Top Skill | Key Differentiator | Industry"

## LinkedIn Outreach Messages

**Note:** These are for connecting with job seekers, career coaches, recruiters, and HR professionals. Personalize each one.

---

### LinkedIn Message 1 — To active job seekers

> Hi [Name] — saw you're exploring new opportunities in [industry]. I specialize in resume optimization for [industry] professionals, and I've noticed a few patterns that consistently get callbacks in your space. Would be happy to share some quick tips that might help with your search. No pitch, just genuinely useful stuff. Let me know if you're interested.

---

### LinkedIn Message 2 — To someone who posted about job searching

> [Name], read your post about the job search. The market is tough right now, especially at the [senior/mid] level. One thing I've seen make a measurable difference: aligning your resume keywords to specific JDs rather than using a one-size-fits-all version. Most people don't realize ATS systems score based on keyword match to the specific posting. Happy to elaborate if that's useful.

---

### LinkedIn Message 3 — To recruiters (partnership angle)

> Hi [Name] — I run a resume optimization service for [industry] professionals. I regularly work with candidates who have strong backgrounds but weak presentations — the kind of people who'd be great fits for your roles but get filtered out by ATS. Would love to explore whether there's a way to collaborate: I polish their materials, they become better candidates for your pipeline. Open to a quick chat?

---

### LinkedIn Message 4 — To career coaches (referral partner)

When your clients need polished materials, I handle the writing; you keep coaching. I offer referral commissions and white-label options. Worth a conversation?

---

> Hi [Name] — I help companies support employees through transitions with professional resume and career document services. Whether it's outplacement support, internal mobility programs, or employer branding through LinkedIn optimization, I offer corporate packages at volume pricing. Would this be relevant for [Company]?

---

### LinkedIn Messages 6-10 — Shorter variations

**#6:** Hi [Name] — noticed we're both in [industry]. I help professionals at your level get more interview callbacks through strategic resume optimization. Not a pitch — just connecting with people in the space. Would love to have you in my network.

**#7:** [Name], your background in [skill] is impressive. If you ever consider a move, I specialize in positioning professionals like you for senior roles. Always happy to do a free 5-minute resume audit. Let me know.

**#8:** Saw your post about [topic]. Couldn't agree more. I work with [industry] professionals on career positioning — resumes, LinkedIn, the whole package. Would love to connect.

**#9:** Hi [Name] — I optimize resumes and LinkedIn profiles for [industry] professionals targeting [level] roles. If you know anyone in your network who might benefit, I'd appreciate the referral. Happy to return the favor.

## Key Messaging Principles

1. **Lead with the problem** — ATS rejection, weak achievement statements, keyword mismatch
2. **Quantify the ROI** — "One successful salary negotiation pays for this 10x"
3. **Differentiate from cheap alternatives** — "Not templates. Not generic. Tailored to YOUR target roles."
4. **Urgency without sleaze** — "Every week with an unoptimized resume is a week of missed interviews"
5. **Credibility through specificity** — Show you know the mechanics (ATS, STAR method, keyword density)
